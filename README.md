# McGill Coding Club workshops

This repository hosts some content of the School of Human Nutrition
Coding Club. While some theoretical aspects about statistics and
analyses are covered, the focus is on the actual coding. The primary
languages used for demonstration are R and SAS.

# Regression workshop (2023-04-28)

The [data used for this
workshop](https://github.com/didierbrassard/CodingClub_workshop/tree/main/data)
is a sample of 1â€™000 respondents aged 19-70 y from the Canadian
Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2015 - Nutrition. Please note that
example analyses are **not** survey analysis per se, i.e., they would
not be appropriate for analysis of the CCHS 2015 - Nutrition.
[Regression analyses for complex sampling survey analyses require
consideration of the survey
design](https://didierbrassard.github.io/posts/2022/10/blog-post-5/).
However, for demonstration purpose, it is assumed that the sample data
is a random sample of the population of Canadian adults.
