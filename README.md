# McGill Coding Club workshops

This repository hosts some content of the School of Human Nutrition
Coding Club. While some theoretical aspects about statistics and
analyses are covered, the focus is on the actual coding. The primary
languages used for demonstration are R and SAS.

# Regression workshop (2023-04-28)

The data used for this workshop is a sample of 1â€™000 respondents aged
19-70 y from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2015 -
Nutrition.

> Please note that example analyses are **not** survey analysis per se,
> i.e., they would not be appropriate for analysis of the CCHS 2015 -
> Nutrition. [Regression analyses for complex sampling survey analyses
> require consideration of the survey
> design](https://didierbrassard.github.io/posts/2022/10/blog-post-5/).
> However, for demonstration purpose, it is assumed that the sample data
> is a random sample of the population of Canadian adults.
