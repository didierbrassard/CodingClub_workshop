   abstract = {BACKGROUND: With progress on both the theoretical and the computational fronts the use of spline modelling has become an established tool in statistical regression analysis. An important issue in spline modelling is the availability of user friendly, well documented software packages. Following the idea of the STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies initiative to provide users with guidance documents on the application of statistical methods in observational research, the aim of this article is to provide an overview of the most widely used spline-based techniques and their implementation in R. METHODS: In this work, we focus on the R Language for Statistical Computing which has become a hugely popular statistics software. We identified a set of packages that include functions for spline modelling within a regression framework. Using simulated and real data we provide an introduction to spline modelling and an overview of the most popular spline functions. RESULTS: We present a series of simple scenarios of univariate data, where different basis functions are used to identify the correct functional form of an independent variable. Even in simple data, using routines from different packages would lead to different results. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrate challenges that an analyst faces when working with data. Most differences can be attributed to the choice of hyper-parameters rather than the basis used. In fact an experienced user will know how to obtain a reasonable outcome, regardless of the type of spline used. However, many analysts do not have sufficient knowledge to use these powerful tools adequately and will need more guidance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Nutrition screening should be initiated on hospital admission by non-dietitians. This research aimed to validate and assess the reliability of the Canadian Nutrition Screening Tool (CNST) in the 'real-world' hospital setting. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Adult patients were admitted to surgical and medical wards only (no palliative patients). Study 1--Nutrition Care in Canadian Hospitals (n=1014): development of the CNST (3 items: weight loss, decrease food intake, body mass index (BMI)) and exploratory assessment of its criterion and predictive validity. Study 2--Inter-rater reliability and criterion validity assessment of the tool completed by untrained nursing personnel or diet technician (DT) (n=150). Subjective Global Assessment performed by site coordinators was used as a gold standard for comparison. RESULTS: Study 1: The CNST completed by site coordinators showed good sensitivity (91.7%) and specificity (74.8%). Study 2: In the subsample of untrained personnel (160 nurses; one DT), tool's reliability was excellent (Kappa=0.88), sensitivity was good (>90%) but specificity was low (47.8%). However, using a two-item ('yes' on both weight change and food intake) version of the tool improved the specificity (85.9%). BMI was thus removed to promote feasibility. The final two-item tool (study 1 sample) has a good predictive validity: length of stay (P<0.001), 30-day readmission (P=0.02; X(2) 5.92) and mortality (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The simple and reliable CNST shows good sensitivity and specificity and significantly predicts adverse outcomes. Completion by several untrained nursing personnel confirms its utility in the nursing admission assessment.},

   abstract = {High intakes of dietary sodium are associated with elevated blood pressure levels and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. National and international guidelines recommend reduced sodium intake in the general population, which necessitates population-wide surveillance. We assessed the utility of casual (spot) urine specimens in estimating 24-hour urinary sodium excretion as a marker of sodium intake in the International Cooperative Study on Salt, Other Factors, and Blood Pressure. There were 5,693 participants recruited in 1984-1987 at the ages of 20-59 years from 29 North American and European samples. Participants were randomly assigned to test or validation data sets. Equations derived from casual urinary sodium concentration and other variables in the test data were applied to the validation data set. Correlations between observed and estimated 24-hour sodium excretion were 0.50 for individual men and 0.51 for individual women; the values were 0.79 and 0.71, respectively, for population samples. Bias in mean values (observed minus estimated) was small; for men and women, the values were -1.6 mmol per 24 hours and 2.3 mmol per 24 hours, respectively, at the individual level and -1.8 mmol per 24 hours and 2.2 mmol per 24 hours, respectively, at the population level. Proportions of individuals with urinary 24-hour sodium excretion above the recommended levels were slightly overestimated by the models. Casual urine specimens may be a useful, low-burden, low-cost alternative to 24-hour urine collections for estimation of population sodium intakes; ongoing calibration with study-specific 24-hour urinary collections is recommended to increase validity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The validity of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for body composition analysis is limited by assumptions relating to body shape. Improvement in BIA technology could overcome these limitations and reduce the population specificity of the BIA algorithm. SUBJECTS/METHODS: BIA equations for the prediction of fat-free mass (FFM), total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW) were generated from data obtained on 124 Caucasians (body mass index 18.5-35 kg/m(2)) using a four-compartment model and dilution techniques as references. The algorithms were validated in an independent multiethnic population (n=130). The validity of BIA results was compared (i) between ethnic groups and (ii) with results from the four-compartment model and two-compartment methods (air-displacement plethysmography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and deuterium dilution). RESULTS: Indices were developed from segmental R and Xc values to represent the relative contribution of trunk and limbs to total body conductivity. The coefficient of determination for all prediction equations was high (R(2): 0.94 for ECW, 0.98 for FFM and 0.98 for TBW) and root mean square error was low (1.9 kg for FFM, 0.8 l for ECW and 1.3 kg for TBW). The bias between BIA results and different reference methods was not statistically different between Afro-American, Hispanic, Asian or Caucasian populations and showed a similar difference (-0.2-0.2 kg FFM) when compared with the bias between different two-compartment reference methods (-0.2-0.3 kg FFM). CONCLUSIONS: An eight-electrode, segmental multifrequency BIA is a valid tool to estimate body composition in healthy euvolemic adults compared with the validity and precision of other two-compartment reference methods. Population specificity is of minor importance when compared with discrepancies between different reference methods.},

   abstract = {It is widely but incorrectly believed that the t-test and linear regression are valid only for Normally distributed outcomes. The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.},
